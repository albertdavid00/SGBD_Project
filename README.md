# Shops-Management-Database
The project is made for the management of data for multiple shops using PL/SQL. <br>
For every shop in the databas, information about the customers and their orders is stored. <br>
In the project one can find some simulated exercises on the database that include:
* DML & DDL operations
* Packages and functions/procedures 
* Mutating triggers
* Cursors
